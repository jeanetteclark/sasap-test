Read in catch data from [Mike Byerly. Alaska commercial salmon catches by management region (1886- 1997). Gulf of Alaska Data Portal. df35b.304.2.](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/df35b.304.2)

```{r}
catch_df <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(catch_df)
```

`select` the columns we need for analysis
`gather` to move from wide to long
`rename` a column to indicate units

```{r}
catch_clean <- catch_df %>% 
  #select(Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum)
  select(-All, -notesRegCode) %>% 
  gather(key = "species", value = "catch", -Region, -Year) %>% 
  rename(catch_thousands = catch)

tail(catch_clean)
```



```{r}

```
